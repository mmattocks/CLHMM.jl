Churbanov Linear Memory Backwards Pass Baum Welch HMM Optimisation
Intended for use with [BGHMM.jl](https://github.com/mmattocks/BGHMM.jl) in distributed training of large model "zoos" of background genomic hidden markov models. Allows observations arrays with multiple observations sequences (intended for categorical dists only- end of sequence is indexed by a trailing zero 0).
